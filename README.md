# hub-api

The backend for a project I'm working on, called Hub.

This api serves a couple purposes:

1.) Help manage things related to school (tasks, homework) and other misc. things (bookmarks)
2.) Further my understanding of Go
3.) Further my understanding of RESTful APIs

# Running

`go run main.go` will start the API
